        "\n",
        "Hypothesis testing is a statistical method used to make decisions based on data. It involves making an assumption (the hypothesis), then using sample data to test the validity of that assumption through formal procedures.\n",
        "\n",
        "---\n",
        "\n",
        "### 2. What is the null hypothesis, and how does it differ from the alternative hypothesis?\n",
        "\n",
        "* **Null hypothesis (H₀)**: States there is no effect or no difference.\n",
        "* **Alternative hypothesis (H₁)**: States there is an effect or a difference.\n",
        "  The goal is often to reject H₀ in favor of H₁ based on sample evidence.\n",

        "\n",
        "### 3. What is the significance level in hypothesis testing, and why is it important?\n",
        "\n",
        "The significance level (denoted as α) is the threshold for rejecting the null hypothesis, commonly set at 0.05. It represents the probability of making a Type I error (false positive).\n",
        "\n",
        "---\n",
        "\n",
        "### 4. What does a P-value represent in hypothesis testing?\n",
        "\n",
        "A P-value is the probability of obtaining results as extreme as, or more extreme than, those observed, assuming the null hypothesis is true.\n",
        "\n",

        "### 6. What are Type 1 and Type 2 errors in hypothesis testing?\n",
        "\n",
        "* **Type 1 error (α)**: Rejecting H₀ when it's actually true.\n",

        "* **Two-tailed**: Tests for effect in both directions.\n",

        "### 8. What is the Z-test, and when is it used in hypothesis testing?\n",
        "\n",
        "A Z-test is used to determine whether two population means are different when the variances are known and sample size is large (n > 30).\n",

        "### 10. What is the T-distribution, and when should it be used instead of the normal distribution?\n",
        "\n",
        "The T-distribution is used when the sample size is small (n < 30) and/or the population variance is unknown.\n",
        "\n",

        "### 14. What is a confidence interval, and how is it used to interpret statistical results?\n",
        "\n",
        "A confidence interval gives a range of values within which the true population parameter is expected to fall, with a specified level of confidence (e.g., 95%).\n",

        "---\n",
        "\n",
        "### 15. What is the margin of error, and how does it affect the confidence interval?\n",
